# Usage

The most basic usage of Directory - Listing Templates is to create a static site or simple
app.that process looks something
like this:

1. Set up the basic structure of the site.
2. Add some content, style, and functionality.
3. Run your site locally to see how it looks.
4. Deploy your site.

Cool, right? _It is_. That said, the smart defaults, baseline elements, default
attribute values and various other utilities that Directory - Listing Templates offers can
serve as the foundation for whatever you're interested in building.

Even the basic use-case of a simple static site can be enhanced by manipulating
the code through an automated build process. Moving up in complexity Directory - Listing Templates 
can be integrated with whatever front-end framework, CMS or
e-commerce platform you're working with. Mix-and-match to your heart's content.
Use what you need (toss it in a blender if you need to) and discard the rest.
